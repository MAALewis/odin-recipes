    <h1>Pasta with Italian Sausage</h1>
    <p>This is the part where a cooking blog would talk about their long lost aunt who gave them this recipe. &nbsp;Why lie?  I stole it and modified it from an amazing cookbook that I highly recommend and you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cordon-Bleu-Quick-Classics/dp/0304351806">find it here.</a></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop onion and layout remaining ingredients.  Heat 1 tbsp oil in skillet and brown sausages in it.  When browned set aside on paper towel.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in skillet, add onion and cook to desired caramelization.  Add garlic and a good pinch of salt and cook till garlic colors.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and 1/4 c water.  Bring to simmer and cook 10 min, stirring to incorporate frond.</li>
        <li>Bring pasta water to rolling boil (Shoot for 2% salt content or 2 tbsp for 1 gallon.)</li>
        <li>While water is boiling cut the sausages into thick slices and add to sauce.</li>
        <li>As the sauce is reducing cook the pasta to al dente and season the sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, return to warm pot, add the sauce and mix.  Serve immediately with parmesan cheese.</li>
        <p><em>Note: &nbsp;</em>If you wish to add additional vegetables (sweet peppers and eggplant work well) they should be added in after the onion is softened and then cooked together before adding the garlic.</p>
    </ol>
