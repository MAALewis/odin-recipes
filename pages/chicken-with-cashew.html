    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken into bite size pieces and place in bowl.  Grate 1/3 or ginger over chicken, add salt, pepper, rice wine, and sesame oil.  Lightly beat egg whites and mix into chicken with cornstarch.  Cover and set aside while preparing remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Shred the remaining ginger.  Cut the scallions into 2 inch lengths.  Cut the bell pepper into bit size pieces.  Drain the pineapple and set aside.  Measure and set aside remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce.  In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with 1 tbsp cold water, then add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Prepare your chosen side and set it to cook so it will be finished at the same time.  If cooking rice you may want to start this first but the extra time marinating will not hurt the chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok over moderate heat.  Add the dried chilies and stir-fry until they begin to darken in color.  Increase the heat to high and continue stirring until the chilies are almost black.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and stir-fry until it is white, then add remaining ginger, scallions, pepper, pineapple, cashews, and the sauce mixture.  Stir-fry until all ingredients are glossy and the sauce has thickened.  3-6 minutes on average.</li>
        <p><em>Note: &nbsp;</em>Serve immediately alongside rice and be careful to either remove dried chiles or warn your guests.</p>
