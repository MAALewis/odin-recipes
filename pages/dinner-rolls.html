    <h1>Parker House style rolls</h1>
    <p>I don't normally bake yeasted breads but during the holidays there is something special about a home made roll.  I recommend accompanying with a homemade whipped butter - I included a mini recipe to go with the rolls.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, 1/2 c sugar, butter, and salt in a medium saucepan.  Heat over medium heat till butter melts.  Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.  <strong>(Must be below 110 deg)</strong></li>
        <li>While milk cools, dissolve yeast and 1 tbsp sugar in warm water.  Let stand 10 min.  If yeast has not bubbled you <strong>must</strong> repeat this step.</li>
        <li>In bowl or large mixer combine 3 c flour and milk mixture.  Beat on low for 30 sec, scraping as you go.  Add yeast mixture and beat on high for 3 min.</li>
        <li>Add beaten eggs. <strong>Eggs must be pre-beaten.</strong> Then stir in as much remaining flour as needed to make a <em>soft</em> dough.  Should come away from bowl but stick to finger.</li>
        <li>Cover bowl with a clean cloth and place in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.  Meanwhile prep two 9x13 pans by lining with cooking spray or melted butter.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough, lightly flour work surface, turn out dough, and divide in half.  Roll out each half into a rectangle then cut into 12 equal pieces each.  Shape each piece into a ball and space into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Cover with a clean cloth and allow to rise in a warm place for 30 min.  Meanwhile pre-heat oven to 375 deg.  When ready bake for 15-18 min until golden brown.</li>
        <p><em>Note: &nbsp;</em>When you pull the rolls from the oven rub a stick of cold butter over the top of the rolls while still hot and let cool.</p>
    </ol>
