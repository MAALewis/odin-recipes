    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift together cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a mixer fully cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy.  Then add in one egg at a time until combined, scraping as you go.  Add in vanilla and mix.  Gradually add in dry ingredients until just moistened. (<em>do not overmix</em>) Fold in chocolate until evenly dispersed.</li>
        <li>Remove mixing bowl, cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and chill in fridge for 24 hours <strong>MINIMUM</strong> or as long as 72 hours.</li>
        <li>After dough has rested fully, remove from fridge and allow to come to room temp.  Pre-heat oven to 350 deg.  Line baking sheets and scoop out dough using a medium <a href="https://www.everythingkitchens.com/oxo-medium-cookie-scoop.html">dough scooper.</a> Do not press dough down and do not crown the sheet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle dough balls with celtic salt and then bake for 10-12 minutes for smaller cookies or 18-20 for larger. <strong>Watch carefully for browning on edges and do not crowd the oven.</strong> Working in small batches and with only one pan in the middle rack at a time will help with even cooking an consistent temps.  Use an oven thermometer to monitor temps.</li>
        <li>Allow cookies to cool on pan while second pan is cooking.  When next pan is half baked transfer to cooling rack and reset the first pan for another batch.</li>
        <p><em>Note: &nbsp;</em>I suggest allowing cookies to cool completely before storing but obviously you should eat a few warm while you are at it.</p>
