Welcome to my "first" website project with odin.

This is a private recipe book that I intend to continue working with as I progress to hold most of my personal go to recipes so that I can easily share them with friends and family.  I want to take the time to make sure and personalize each project to guarantee the knowledge base I am building sticks.  As such I will return to this project as I learn more items and can polish the site further.

As this is a starting project the aims of the lesson are to show proficiency with basic HTML programming, some initial CSS styling and provide a platform to showcase my growing development skills.  To start I am planning to include multiple pages, basic style functions, images, and linking across the site and to some outside locations.

This is my starting point, let's see where this goes.
